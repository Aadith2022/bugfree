### Upon Clicking the Login page, you will be presented with the following. 

On this page, a User can login if they already have an existing account. If a user is an administrator for an Institution, they can provide that Intitution's 'Admin Password' on login to be taken to their adminstator account.

The user that is registering the new Institution will automatically be added to the list of Admin for that Institution.

## View Tickets Section

If there are no tickets for an Institution, this page will instruct users to wait until a Submitter has submitted new tickets

For a Submitter, this page will display all of the tickets that they have created, if there are none, they will be instructed to a new ticket

When creating a ticket, a submitter can include the following information: title, description, type, priority (which can be either Low, Medium, or High), as well the project that they want this project to be associated with. Whenever a ticket is created, its default status is 'New', this can be changed by the Developer, which will be discussed later

![image](https://github.com/Aadith2022/bugfree/assets/113648765/d096e2af-36b5-4fb2-9973-2f05f2cd484a)


After tickets have been created, the 'View Tickets' section will display additional informationn depending on the role of the user that is logged in:

* For admin, this section will display all of the tickets that are in this Institution
* For Project Managers, this section will display only the tickets that are associated with the projects that they are the managers of
* For Developers, this section will only show the tickets that they have been explicitly assigned to (More on this later)

## Update Tickets

Admins, Project Managers, and Developers have the ability to update tickets. Admins and Project Managers ahve the ability can update every aspect of a ticket, weheras developers can only update the status and priority of tickets. The Admin, Project Managers, and Developers all have the power to change the status of a ticket to one of the following: New, Open, In Progress, Resolved, and Additional Information Required

By default, when Tickets are created they do not have a devloper assigned to them, so it is up to either the Admin or the Project Manager to assign a deveoper to a given ticket

This is how updating a ticket looks for both the Admin and Project Manager:

This is how it looks on the developer side:

## Ticket Details

In the View Tickets section, users have the ability to view additional details of that ticket, such as when it was created as well as all of the history associated with that ticket. Additionally, in this section, users have the ability to leave comments on a ticket

![image](https://github.com/Aadith2022/bugfree/assets/113648765/049ed445-a56f-4d82-a236-63b998c610da)

## Notifications

Whenever a user leaves a comment on a ticket, both the developer and submitter of the ticket will be notified of the comment. Users can see that they have new notifications when the Notification logo turns white, as follows

![image](https://github.com/Aadith2022/bugfree/assets/113648765/856ca453-e0b9-448f-9c69-a3c149163d2a)

Upon pressing it, a user can see all of their notifications as well as when the notification was sent

![image](https://github.com/Aadith2022/bugfree/assets/113648765/c8b95b4f-a8a1-4f6f-9c67-a2d61f6bc8ad)

When the status of a Ticket turns to 'Additional Information Required', the Submitter of that ticket will get a ticket informing them to provide additional information on that ticket immediately

![image](https://github.com/Aadith2022/bugfree/assets/113648765/be61a3fc-1062-419b-b536-c759e4ae7f66)

Then when that Submitter looks at the 'View Tickets' page again, they will see that their ticket will be labeled as 'Action Required', where they are required to change either the title or the description of the ticket, otherwise they will get an error
